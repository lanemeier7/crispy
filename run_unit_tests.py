CRISPY Unit Test Runner

‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATED: This legacy test runner has been replaced by pytest.
This script now redirects to the modern pytest framework for better reliability.

For direct pytest usage:
  pytest                    # Run all tests
  pytest -m unit           # Unit tests only  
  pytest -m working        # Working tests only
  pytest --cov=crispy      # With coverage

For more options, use the modern test runners:
  python run_tests.py --help
  python run_simple_tests.py
